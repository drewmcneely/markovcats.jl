Files edited by Claude (search for "ADDED BY CLAUDE" / "MODIFIED BY CLAUDE" / "COMMENTED OUT BY CLAUDE"):

1. src/categories/gauss.jl
   - Added hom_to_obs(k::GaussianKernel) — returns (dom_ob, codom_ob) as GaussStateSpace values
     so the functor can infer object dimensions from concrete kernels.

2. src/pipeline.jl
   - Added `using GATlab.SymbolicModels: functor` import
   - Added _extract_kernels — walks a ParsedExpr tree collecting all KernelExpr leaf nodes
   - Added _infer_ob_map — parses the pipe expression, matches variable names to kernel
     inputs/outputs, calls hom_to_obs to get dimensions, builds a Symbol→GaussStateSpace dict
   - Added evaluate_markov_program — orchestrates the full pipeline: to_markov_expr → infer obs → functor

3. src/dsl/macros.jl
   - Commented out @kernelassignments, pipeline_kl, pipeline_pg (referenced undefined types
     KernelList and PortGraph — these were already broken before, just never loaded)
   - Added @markov_program macro — walks the begin block, separates assignments from the
     @pipe sub-block, generates code that evaluates assignments, builds gen_map, and calls
     evaluate_markov_program

4. src/MarkovCats.jl
   - Added exports: hom_to_obs, @markov_program, evaluate_markov_program
   - Added include("dsl/macros.jl")

5. examples/sandbox.jl
   - Added @markov_program usage example at the bottom
